# Mindful Mapping

## Description

Mindful Mapping was created with students, professionals, and everyday folks in mind. Our lives can get really hectic and it can be extremly difficult to track everything going on. Mindful Mapping was created to solve that persistant daily issue - What do I have going on and when?

## Usage
Once you arrive at https://tehila03.github.io/Workflow-App/ you can start tracking what you have coming up. Our simple to use side bar allows the user to name the activity, select type of event, start and length time. To the right of the side bar, the user will see each event they have created and filter through the different types.
